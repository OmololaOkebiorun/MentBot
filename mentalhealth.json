Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child's mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."]},

There are lots of small things we can change to improve or maintain good mental health and wellbeing without spending lots of money to do it. \nDiet\nEating fresh fruit and vegetables daily helps provide the nutrients needed to nourish your mind and body. Keeping regular meal times and choosing foods that release energy slowly, such as oats and unrefined wholegrains, also help. Reducing your intake of caffeine, alcohol and sugary foods in the evening also helps as they can all disturb your sleep patterns. \nSleep \nThereâ€™s a close relationship between sleep and mental health. Living with a mental health problem can affect how well you sleep, and poor sleep can have a negative impact on your mental health, so prioritising sleep can help both with maintaining your wellbeing and your recovery.\\nBeing outdoors \nThere is strong evidence to suggest that the combined mix of colours, sounds and smells we find outdoors act together to stimulate our senses, which helps increase our overall wellbeing. This means that gardening and other outdoor hobbies often provide a brilliant alternative to traditional sports and exercise. \nExercise \nStructured physical activity can play a key role in someoneâ€™s recovery from a mental health problem and in staying well for years to come. When you exercise, your brain chemistry changes through the release of â€˜feel goodâ€™ hormones called endorphins. \nJoining activity groups such as a running club is a fantastic way of improving your social network. Being sociable and connecting with other people is rewarding in its own right and can significantly improve mental wellbeing. Group yoga or Pilates classes can help you learn breathing techniques, which can encourage you to relax and switch off from external stresses."]}
